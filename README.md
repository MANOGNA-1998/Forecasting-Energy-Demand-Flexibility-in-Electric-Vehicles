Demand Flexibility:

Demand Flexibility refers to the portion of demand in the system that can be shifted within a specific duration.
Demand Flexibility can help make electricity more affordable by helping customers use more power when prices are high. 
Properly regulated, this will help in making the electricity grids more reliable.


Demand Flexibility in Electric Vehicles:

The worldâ€™s EV population is growing at an exponential rate. In 2020, the total count of electric vehicles worldwide was about 7 million, which is about a 500% 
increase since 2016 when it was only about 1.2 million. This trend has only strengthened with world moving towards adopting to electric vehicles as their daily drivers. 
Car manufacturers investing heavily in the EV market, and the government offering incentives has only resulted in getting more electric vehicles on road.
This increasing number of electric vehicles resulted in an increase in number of charging stations across the world. It is estimated that US alone could 
end up using 25% more electricity than it does today.This will invariably increase the stress on the electricity grids. Hence might make them unreliable and comparatively 
costlier to maintain and to use for customers.Hence the application of Demand Flexibility in this area will help in properly utilizing the electricity.
This can make charging more affordable for EV drivers by helping them charge at a time when the price is low. This will also keep the grid more reliable even with the predicted increase in the number of electric vehicles.
With the trend observed and what is predicted, it is clear that we are moving towards Electric Vehicles and hence, more charging stations will be created 
and more electricity will be consumed from the grid to serve this increasing demand due to the influx in EVs. Hence Demand Flexibility Analysis in this area 
will prove to very beneficial in properly utilizing the grid and also in providing affordable charging sessions to the users.
Demand Flexibility in time interval [t, t + delta] is the amount of charge that can be delayed during that particular time interval.
